## Created with Capacitor Create App

This app was created using [`@capacitor/create-app`](https://github.com/ionic-team/create-capacitor-app),
and comes with a very minimal shell for building an app.

### Running this example

```bash
npm start
```

### Building this example

```bash
npm run build
```

To see the built app in `dist/`, you can use [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

```bash
npx serve dist/
```
